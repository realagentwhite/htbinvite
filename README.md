# HTB INVITE CODE GENERATOR

### What is this?
This is a simple python script that will generate an invite code downloaded
from HTB [hackthebox.eu](https://hackthebox.eu)

This was meant to help generate an invite code for HTB
This is kind of cheating since getting the invite code will be the 'first'
hack you will do on the platform but also on the actual HTB.
So I encourage you to not use this script but rather do it yourself

### How to use it

- Help menu: 
  `python generate.py -h`
- Run without checkinf for internet connection:
  `python generate.py --no-network-connection`
- Run as normal:
  `python generate.py <number>`
- Run as normal without checking internet connection
  `python generate.py --no-network-connection`

Remember, the number of codes has to be at the end. Else it will delete your C:\ drive (not really, just messing with you)
